# R-for-Report-Automation
Presented at Big Data Ignite 2018, Grand Rapids, MI

Together, these files should help the user generate 32 individualized PDF reports for each of the cars in the mtcars data set (which is publically available, baked into every installation of base R). Simply make sure all the files exist in a single directory before sourcing the "Generate My Reports.R" script. Note this program will create a subdirectory to generate the reports. The user will have to add pertinent information about his/her email client in order for the email portion of the code to execute.

An installation of miktek is required in order to produce the PDFs. Have fun! Let me know if there are any questions!
